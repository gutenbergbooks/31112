<p><a name="Stigmatization" id="Stigmatization">Stigmatization</a> is a rare incident of ecstasy. Not
many well authenticated cases have been reported by competent
medical authorities, and yet there can be no doubt of
its occasional occurrence. See Encyclopaedia Britannica,
article on Stigmatization by Dr. Macalister, and references
therein cited; also the work on Nervous and Mental Diseases
by Dr. Landon Carter Gray, page 511. That it may
occur in men of a high order of ability is instanced by the
case of St. Francis of Assisi.</p>

<p>It ought not to be necessary to point out that the entire
third scene in the second act of this play is a dramatic transcript
from the diseased consciousness of Mr. Dimsdell, that
the Satan of the play is an hallucination, and that the impress
of the stigma upon Dimsdell's breast is merely the
culmination of his auto-hypnotic ecstasy, or trance.</p>

Well versed in all the wisdom of the time;<br />
Somewhat well gone in years, but lovable<br />
Beyond the shallowness of youth, and rich<br />
In mellow charity. Oft hath he sailed<br />
With me from port to port where learning drew him,<br />
And still came richer home. One day he shipped<br />
For Amsterdam and brought his bride, who, like<br />
A hawthorn in its pink of youth that blushes<br />
'Neath the shadow of an ancient elm,<br />
Shed spring-time sweetness round his green old age.<br />
I've seen them often in their Holland home,<br />
Where wisdom laid its treasures at the feet<br />
Of love, and beauty crowned the offering.<br />
She was a lovely lady, Ursula,<br />
And when her lord, still bent on learning more,<br />
Resolved to come out to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">America&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
His own affairs then calling him to <span style="white-space: nowrap;">England&mdash;</span><br />
He placed her in my care, intending soon<br />
To follow her. He did, but curs&eacute;d fate!<br />
His ship was lost&mdash;no one knows where!</p>

<p><i>Ursula.</i> <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Alack</span><br />
The day! She had not sinned had he been here.</p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> But, didst thou know her, Ursula, as I<br />
Have known her, wisely good and true, thou wouldst<br />
Have wondered more.</p>

<p><i>Ursula.</i> <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Know her, sir! I nursed her!</span></p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Thou, Ursula?</p>

<p><i>Ursula.</i> <span style="margin-left: 7em;">None but I!</span></p>

<p><i>Butts.</i> Where were her friends?</p>

<p><i>Ursula.</i> <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Where, but at home! Dear heart,</span><br />
They shunned her like the plague&mdash;though if the truth<br />

Banish me not.<br />

From the very hour when, as the spring<br />
Of nature dragged my anchors loose, the soft<br />
Entreaty of a lover's sigh did blow<br />
Concurrent with my tide, and swept me out<br />

<p><i>Governor.</i> Thou art most obstinate. What say you now,<br />
Grave councilors? Need we delay the sentence?</p>

<p><i>Bronson.</i> Quick to forgive and slow in condemnation,<br />
Would be our wisest course in such a case.<br />
The life she hath God gave; we should not take it;<br />
Nor should we banish her, for she is useful,<br />
And with her needle doth assist the poor.<br />
There is provision in our law to fit<br />
This crime when neither death nor banishment<br />
Is proper. It is: [<i>Reading</i>] "Th' adulteress shall stand<br />
Upon the pillory; and on her breast<br />
Shall wear a scarlet letter A, to mark<br />
Her criminal incontinence."</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> <span style="margin-left: 12em;">A good</span><br />
Suggestion truly; we had forgot the clause<br />
From long disuse. What say you?</p>

<p><i>Ward.</i> I think it wise.</p>

<p><i>Arnold.</i> <span style="margin-left: 8em;">'Twill be more merciful.</span></p>

<p><i>Langdon.</i> A living warning 'gainst adultery.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> It is our suffrage.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> <span style="margin-left: 12em;">So be it then.</span><br />
Hester, thou art to stand upon the pillory<br />
A little while, and wear upon thy breast<br />
The Scarlet Letter "A" forever;<br />
This see thou do on pain of instant death<br />
Or banishment. Hath anyone a piece<br />
Of scarlet cloth?</p>

<p><i>Bronson.</i> I have the letter here prepared.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> Clerk, affix the letter to her breast.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Roger Prynne</span>, clad as in Scene I.&mdash;He keeps to the
rear of Hester.</i></p>

<p class="p00">Now, Jailer, lead her to the pillory,<br />
There let her stand unbound.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Hester ascends steps to pillory platform.</i></p>

<p class="p00">Dimsdell, you are her pastor, speak to her.<br />
Hold up her sin before her eyes, and warn<br />
The multitude by her example.</p>

<p><i>Dimsdell.</i> I beg you, sir, let Dr. Wilson speak.</p>

<p><i>Wilson.</i> Nay, Dimsdell. Nay, the charge is yours.<br />
Speak on. And plead that she disclose the man<br />
Who was her paramour.</p>

<p><i>Dimsdell.</i> I pray you pardon me. I am not well.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> Not well? 'Tis but compassion weakens thee.<br />
Speak man! thy words are gentlest and will draw<br />
Her secret from her, though ours do seal her lips.<br />
Proceed, Dimsdell.</p>

<p><i>Dimsdell.</i> We wrong her nature when we seek to know<br />
That which her heart doth teach her to conceal;<br />
Yet at your bidding will I plead with her.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Goes over to pillory.</i></p>

<p class="p00">Hester, look down upon me; let thine ear<br />
Receive my meaning with the sound I make;<br />
Behold in me the body of the Council,<br />
Not me alone; and hear my words as though<br />
The general voice, speaking in concert true,<br />
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span>

Did intone them.<br />
For it were vain presumption to expect<br />
That, what the Governor could not extract,<br />
My words alone could move thee to disclose.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> A modest gentleman, truly!</p>

<p><i>Dimsdell.</i> Upon thy sin I dwell not; the penalty<br />
Which thou dost suffer preaches repentance;<br />
And in thy nature there is naught to lead thee<br />
Twice astray.<br />
There's not an eye that now doth look upon thee<br />
But pities thee, and doubt thou not, if he<br />
Who wronged thee is present here, his heart is wrung<br />
With bitterest remorse. Wilt speak his name?</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> I will not.</p>

<p><i>Dimsdell.</i> I do command thee by the Commonwealth,<br />
I do entreat thee for thy reputation,<br />
I do implore thee for thy soul's salvation,<br />
Give up his name.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> I would not breathe his name to anyone;<br />
Nay, not to him who was my husband, though<br />
The sea should cast him up to question me.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Woman, who did seduce thee?</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> <span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">I keep my vow.</span></p>

<p><i>Dimsdell.</i> Hester, deceive thyself no more; look down<br />
Upon me once again. Believe me, Hester,<br />
No pain the world could now inflict would harm<br />
Thy recreant lover. To see thee here set up<br />
The target of a thousand curious eyes,<br />
Thy beauties blistered in the noonday sun,<br />
Thy gentle breast seared with yon scarlet letter,<br />
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Would burn that image on his soul. Have mercy,<br />
Hester, forgive his cowardice, do thou<br />
Act for him; pronounce his name and let him die<br />
To satisfy his crime.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> I will not drag him down with me.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Oh! glorious generosity misplaced!</p>

<p><i>Dimsdell.</i> Your generosity hath led you once<br />
Astray; do not allow it now to aid<br />
Him in hypocrisy. For, Hester, you,<br />
Who know his weaknesses and aspirations,<br />
His station in his calling, his place in life<br />
Among us, will be a party to deception<br />
If now you hide his name.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> I answer to my God. No man shall know<br />
That which is only known to me and him.<br />
But speak thou on his crime!</p>

<p class="pt00"><i>Dimsdell.</i> Ho! all ye people of the commonwealth!<br />

comfortable and handsome. Windows draped in scarlet-fringed

Rich needle work in the hangings and other accessories. A

<p><i>Hester.</i> God bless the little darling, how she sleeps!<br />
Had I but thought that all my heart would beat<br />
Within the tender compass of her arms,<br />
I had not prayed she might not be. But now,<br />
Although unasked she came, unasked she brought<br />
A wealth of love and blessing to my soul.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Sits and embroiders.</i>]</p>

<p class="p00">Thus Providence, although it pierce the heart,<br />
Works into it some glorious design;<br />

Wherein we see no meaning. Nor can we know<br />
The hidden shuttles of Eternity,<br />
That weave the endless web of living, loving,<br />
And begetting, whereby a filament<br />
Of earth takes on the likeness of an angel.<br />
The primal burden of our race-existence,<br />
Mankind's perpetual perpetuation,<br />
Weighs on weak womanhood; we bear the race<br />
And all its natural ills, yet still our fellows,<br />
Who proudly call themselves our lords and masters,<br />
Do heap upon us petty wrongs, and load<br />
Us down with their oppressions. I cannot tell<br />
What rich reward my suffering may bring,<br />
But bide the piercing, like this patient cloth,<br />
In hope the needle carries golden thread.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Roger Prynne</span>, shaved, and dressed as a
doctor of medicine.</i></p>

<p class="p00">Roger himself!</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Thou didst provide snug quarters, Hester, against
my coming. Aye, and hast furnished them better than I
bade thee.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> The cost was small; my needle and my <span style="white-space: nowrap;">energy&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Have done the work; yea, and supplied the cradle
also. Ah! 'tis a brave piece of work; very beautiful and
delicate; the lusty offspring of lustful parents. Somewhat
costly, I should think, and asked some pains. Methinks,
thou hadst some help with that; or was it thy needle or thy
energy which wrought this dainty bit?</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Touch not the child; 'tis mine, thou hast no part
in it.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Too true. But calm thyself. I have not harmed
the brat, nor did I touch it. [<i>Looking around.</i>] I like thy
taste, Hester. A handsome house to hold a handsome
woman.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> The house is thine; let me and my babe depart.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Nay, keep the house, 'twill shelter you; I do not
need it.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> I will not have it.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Will not, Madam Hester, is a strong word to use
to your wedded lord and master. I say you shall; yea, and,
furthermore, here is provision for the child and thee.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Throwing purse upon the table.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Take up thy purse. I who have done thee wrong
will not henceforth eat thy bread.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Wrong, Hester. Done me wrong? Wronged me?
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Nay, Hester, wronged thyself; wronged thine innocent
babe; wronged the world; wronged whom thou wilt, but
not wronged me! To wake me from a doting dream&mdash;that
was not wrong! A dream of woman's purity and innocence;
a foolish dream of married happiness between thy
youth and my decrepitude; to put an end to such a madness,
surely was not wrong! Wronged me? Thy levity
hath righted my poor mind, which, pondering o'er thy beauties,
listed to one side.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Oh! pardon me!</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Pardon thee? yea, why should I not? I do pardon
thee; yea, more, I do applaud thine act. Thou wast no
slothful servant; thou didst not fear the coming of thy lord;
thou puttest all to use and gottest cent per cent. Therefore,
the care I show for thee is hire and wages; it is thy due,
accept it freely.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Let me and my babe depart. Receive thy money
and thy house, I can take nothing from thee. Ah! if I could
I would return thee every penny I have spent of thine.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Wait till I ask thee to account. What! am I so
old, and yet not know the cost of dalliance? Nothing
dearer. And he who eared my field during my absence,
being now, in thy abasement, so chary of his presence, spent
little of his gold, I'll warrant. Who is he, Hester?</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Thou shalt never know.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Never's a long word, Hester; it stretches beyond
the judgment into eternity. Come, I'll know him then,
tell me now.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> He is a scholar and can cope with thee; thou canst
not find him.</p>

<p><span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> If he do walk the earth, I'll find him out; if he be
now in Hell, I'll follow him; where'er he be, his peace is
forfeited and I <span style="white-space: nowrap;">will&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> What wilt thou do to him?</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Nothing, Hester, nothing. I merely wish to thank
him for the love he showed thee during my absence, whereby
thou didst mourn for me the less.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Thou wilt not kill him?</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> What a silly thing thou hast become, now thou
hast left the path of virtue! Do I kill thee? Am I dangerous?
Is there force in this withered body to harm a lusty
knave, a brave seducer of ripe womanhood?</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Nay, do not harm him.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> At thy request, mistress.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> The fault was mine.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> No doubt 'twas thine alone.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Wreak vengeance then on me alone.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> I have none.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> I would I could believe thee.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> As well give faith to me as him. But, truly, Hester,
I had thought these puritans, these pilgrim fathers, had left
all fleshly lusts behind them with their vanities in England.
He must be a rare bird in these parts&mdash;O, I shall know him
by his plumage!</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> He's safe enough.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Perhaps, but then these poachers, who fish in
others' ponds, are proud of their achievements. They will
talk. They brag in their cups and strut and ogle when
they're sober.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> I'll warn him of thee.</p>

<p><span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Thou wilt do nothing of the kind. But come,
Hester, man and wife ought not to quarrel. Let us set a good
example to the world in peace if not in chastity. Sit you
here and listen to me.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Well?</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Hester, I loved thee when thou wast a babe,<br />
A prattling child no taller than my knee,<br />
A pretty little innocent, a tot<br />
That wavered in its walk and won my heart<br />
By tender trustfulness. Thou'dt leave thy father,<br />
Mother, all, to nestle in these arms<br />
The whiles I told some worn out fairy tale,<br />
Or sang of Robin Hood.<br />
That was before thy mind did take its shape,<br />
And subsequent events have blotted out<br />
All memories of thy babyhood.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Nay, but I do recall, as in a haze,<br />
Some of the incidents of infancy.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Perhaps. Hester, thou wast the dearest child<br />
That ever blest fond parents, unfolding sweet<br />
Thy mother's beauties and thy father's strength.<br />
And canst thou now remember who made himself<br />
A child to play with thee vain, foolish games;<br />
Who taught thee out of books such lessons as<br />
Thy little mind could grasp?</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> <span style="margin-left: 9em;">It was thou.</span></p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Then, as thou didst grow toward womanhood,<br />
Some fifteen springs, thy gentle mother died;<br />
A woman beautiful and pure, as sweetly<br />
Ignorant of all her charms as is<br />
The hyacinth.</p>

<p><span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mother! Mother!</span></p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Pray God the saints see nothing here on earth:<br />
Or else that in their golden paradise<br />
Some sleepy potion dull their sympathies<br />
With us: for who could look upon this world,<br />
And see mankind divested of the lies<br />
That make our comeliness; or, with an eye undimmed,<br />
Behold the brutal tragedies of life;<br />
And yet find happiness or peace in Heaven?<br />
Hell's flames would reach unto the tree of life<br />
Itself and singe thy mother's heart, if she<br />
Could see that scarlet letter on thy breast.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Hester covers her face and moans.</i>]</p>

<p class="p00">Great God! what thread of continuity<br />
Doth string the whirling incidents of life?<br />
This woman was that maid whose purity<br />
Excelled imagination's greatest reach;<br />
Whose happiness sang ever like the lark<br />
Arising from the earth to soar in Heaven!<br />
And now behold her dyed in scarlet sin,<br />
Branded with infamy, and moaning here<br />
In deepest anguish!<br />
Nay, come; let out thy grief in link&eacute;d words,<br />
For this tooth-gated dumb remorse will herd<br />
Thy thoughts until they gore each other.<br />
Hester, thy strength is greater than to yield<br />
Thus to thy misery; do not lash<br />
Thy heart into a fury; never blow<br />
The tiny sparks of pain<br />
Into the flaming coals of Hell.<br />
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
That sinning soul is traitor to itself<br />
That leagues its bruis&eacute;d thoughts with imps of Hell<br />
To torture conscience.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Leave me, I pray you.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Not yet, else were my visit bootless.<br />
Hester, I will not dwell upon thy life<br />
From year to year, nor drag thy colliered soul<br />
Back to its days of spotless innocence.<br />
Thy father's amity for me, thou knowest,<br />
And how, upon his death, I stood toward thee<br />
In place of parents.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Would you had remained a father to me!</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> I loved thee, Hester; daughter, sister, sweetheart,<br />
You were to me. And you did love me too,<br />
And as an elder brother looked on me<br />
In gentle confidence.<br />
So did the years post by in th' dim afterglow<br />
That comes to ag&eacute;d men; while love with thee<br />
Was in the dawning; a tender sky with both<br />
Of us, my sun already set; and thine<br />
Not yet arisen; nor did it ever rise<br />
To shine on me, fool that I was!</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> I never loved you, should not have married you;<br />
Knew nothing then of love except the name.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Aye, you loved me, and you loved me not;<br />
Hester, I wronged thee when I married thee;<br />
The fault was mine, old as I was, to hope<br />
To still the sweet necessities of youth<br />
With passionless love; nature demands her due,<br />
And we should know, while love may grow at home,<br />
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Passion requires some novelty.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> We both have done foul wrong unto each other,<br />
And, as this world doth judge, mine is the greater.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Yet thou wast tempted by thy youth, my absence,<br />
A handsome lover's importunity:<br />
But what can be said for me, old as I was,<br />
To drive and badger thy chaste ignorance<br />
To marry mine infirmities?</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> How can I right this wrong?</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> And wouldst thou if thou couldst?</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Aye, if I could; but yet these broken lives,<br />
Cracked by my fall, no putty will make whole.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Yet canst thou veil my ruin, and o'er me hang<br />
The drapery of silence. Dost consent?</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Aye, but how?</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> But swear to me thou wilt conceal my name,<br />
Nor ever claim relationship with me,<br />
Until I bid thee.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wherefore the vow?</span></p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Because I wish it;<br />
Perhaps, because I would not bear the scorn,<br />
The petty taunts, the contumelious looks,<br />
That ever greet the cuckold husband.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Then will I take the oath.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Swear by the book, and also by the babe,<br />
Never to breathe my rightful name;<br />
Never to claim me as thy husband;<br />
Never to leave this place.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> Wherefore not leave the place?</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Swear, woman, swear!<br />
<span class="retop"><a href="#top" title="Top of File">top</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Never to leave this place, until I bid thee.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> I swear to all these things.</p>

<p><i>Roger.</i> Swear once again; never to tell thy paramour<br />
Thy husband lives and walks these streets.</p>

<p><i>Hester.</i> I swear to keep thy counsel as I have kept<br />
His and mine own.</p>

<p class="pt00"><i>Roger.</i> Remember then, from this time on, my name<br />

I love thee still; but with a chastened heart<br />
Made wise by sorrow. Day after day, as thou<br />
Dost wend thy way about this mazy world,<br />
My care will shield thee and thy little babe.<br />
Do not repulse it. I have no hope that thou<br />
Wilt think of me without revulsion;<br />
Then hate me if thou must; but spare the thought<br />
That ever thou didst take my hateful kisses,<br />
Or clasp those soft warm arms about my thin,<br />
Cold carcass.<br />
Do not despise thy beauties that I once<br />

The memory of her loveliness<br />
Pervades my waking dreams, and, pleasant theft,<br />
Deprives my sleep of dark oblivion.<br />
And thus, while fleeing from the gentle bonds<br />
Of love, I am become the thrall of passion,<br />
And sigh my heart away in waste desire!<br />
Had I but truly loved her,<br />
Would not our joys, that then were innocent,<br />
Have moulded soul to soul and made mine take<br />
The form of her most dear perfections?<br />
But, now!<br />
No trait of Hester's noble purity<br />
Remains with guilty me, for I purloined<br />
Her precious diadem and like a rogue<br />
I cast that crown away, afraid to wear<br />
What would have been my dearest ornament.<br />
Why can I not repent? Or is it true<br />
Repentance is denied the hypocrite?<br />
And must it then forever be that, though<br />
I cast out sin, both root and branch, the seed<br />
Of evil, scattered long ago, will sprout<br />

With subtle sweetness!<br />
Oh! coward that I am!<br />
Bound down, as to a rock, to form and place,<br />
By iron chains of worldly precedent,<br />
While my desires like eagles tear my breast,<br />
And make of me a base Prometheus.<br />
O, God!<br />
I married all the family of sins,<br />
When I espoused the pleasantest; I am<br />
Become a liar through my lechery,<br />
A thief of reputation through my cowardice,<br />
And&mdash;puh! the rest but follow in the train<br />
Of my dear wedded crime!<br />
O, God! and shall this lust burn on in me<br />
Still unconsumed? Can flagellation, fasting,<br />
Nor fervent prayer itself, not cleanse my soul<br />
From its fond doting on her comeliness?<br />
Oh! heaven! is there no way for me to jump<br />
My middle age and plunge this burning heart<br />
Into the icy flood of cold decay?<br />
None? O, wretched state of luxury!<br />
This hot desire grows even in its death<br />
And from its ashes doth arise full fledged<br />
Renewed eternally!</p>

A learned disquisition on the birth<br />
Of evil? I'd like to hear it, if it tread<br />
Beyond theology's well beaten path;<br />
But, if it stumbles in the pug-mill round<br />
Of teleology, you must excuse me.</p>

<p><i>Satan.</i> Curses but belch foul wind, they pass beyond me.<br />
But, come; I have no time to waste with thee;<br />
This visitation had not been, nor would<br />
I dignify thy carnal slip by my<br />
Incarnate presence, but for thy perfidy.<br />
For thou hast reached a depth of moral baseness<br />
Below the meanest fiend in lowest hell;<br />
Thou hast deserted her who sinned with thee,<br />
Gave up her virtue to express her love,<br />
Laid down her treasure to thy secret lust,<br />
And then took up thy burden with her own.<br />
Think not I come to draft thee of my legions,<br />
I would not have so weak, so mean a coward,<br />
To sow pale fear among them. No!<br />
Thou wilt be damned outside of Hell. I come<br />
To show, as in a mirror, what thou art;<br />
Not what thou shalt be. The past and present both<br />

Or would we put, in place of mother-love,<br />
The cold, hard, formal training of a paid<br />

<p><i>Governor.</i> But is this woman, stained with sin,<br />
A mother to entrust a child to?</p>

<p><i>Dimsdell.</i> That question God hath answered; and we know<br />
The stain of sin doth fade beneath the bleach<br />
Of true repentance; through it all appears<br />
The woven figure of the woman-fabric&mdash;<br />
Her motherhood!<br />
We owe our lives to woman's suffering,<br />
We owe our health unto her temperance,<br />
We owe her all the best of us. Let God<br />
Condemn her sin, but let us not presume<br />
To punish her where He hath healed her heart.</p>

folly in it, this one must be most potent. Now a wise man
would not think there's that virtue in a bit of grease, a
jingling rhyme, and a hair cut, that one might thereby win
a woman's love&mdash;but the wise are fools in love. I have here
the lard of three bears&mdash;one more than the old adage of
"bear and forbear"&mdash;and with it I am to anoint my head
as an enchantment to bring about my marriage to Betsey&mdash;marry,
I'll temper the strength of the charm with a little
bergamot, for in truth two of the bears have been dead over-long.
Whew!&mdash;Aha! enchantment is the only highway to
success in love! Now let me see: "Lady love, lady love,
where'er you <span style="white-space: nowrap;">be"&mdash;</span></p>

like this, bear fat will be worth its weight in gold. But

<p><i>Diggory.</i> Now I wonder where she learnt all those profane

<p><i>Martha.</i> Oh! I beg your pardon, Doctor. Good morning,
sir. I seek my father; is he with the Governor?</p>

worth another rose?</p>

Of her? 'Tis what she wishes most; witness<br />
Her confusion and her telltale blushes.<br />

<p class="pt00"><i>Roger.</i> [<i>Feeling Dimsdell's pulse</i>] There's been no change.<br />
A very long trance.<br />
At times he mumbles; at other times, as now,<br />
He lies like death. If ev'ry murderer<br />
Were stricken with the image of the thing<br />
Which he would deal, 'twould be a blessing! Yet<br />
When consciousness returns, with it will come<br />
The murderous disposition; for in these cases<br />
The mind, although it wanders while the trance<br />
Is on, always comes back upon its path<br />
Where first it left It. Therefore, 'twere wise in me<br />
To be on guard. Well, so I am; but <span style="white-space: nowrap;">what&mdash;</span><br />
What fear should drive me hence, or make me leave<br />
The study of his case? He hath no arms<br />

How many more he's had, God only knows.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> 'Tis most unfortunate that we must lack<br />

Always love high-sounding words more than<br />

When the melody without tunes that within<br />

The orange-blossom take its fragrance from<br />

Thine eyes are blue and deep as Leman's lake<br />

Behold the man for whom you oft have sought,<br />
The man who should have borne The Scarlet Letter;<br />
For I am he.<br />
If that the last words of one sinful man<br />
May warn a multitude from sin, who knows<br />
But that his errors tend toward good at last.<br />
Let me not think my suffering in vain,<br />
Or that my crime confessed will lead on others<br />
Unto their downfall.</p>

I did neglect her in my cowardice,<br />
I shunned the public <span style="white-space: nowrap;">scorn.&mdash;</span><br />

I was a coward; and did deny my child.<br />
